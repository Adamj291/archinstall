# **My 5 script Arch Install (Work in progress)**

## **Prepare**

Once booted into the Arch Live Environment check network connection and then run the following commands:

`pacman -Syyu`
`pacman -S git`
`git clone https://github.com/Adamj291/archinstall.git`
`cd ./archinstall`

## **1-start.sh**

This loads the keymap for UK

## **2-efi**

This checks for the EFI folder as this install is aimed at UEFI systems.

## Manually Partition with cfdisk
